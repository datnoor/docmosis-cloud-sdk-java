/**
 * This class encapsulates a response to a delete template request.
 * 
 * Typically you would use this response to check for success, then decide what action to take.  For example:
 * 
 * 
 * <pre>
 *   DeleteTemplateResponse response = Template
 *                                       .delete()
 *                                       .templateName(fileToDelete)
 *                                       .execute();
 *  if (response.hasSucceeded()) {
 *      //Succeeded
 *  }
 * </pre>
